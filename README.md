# Telecom Customer Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer dataset to uncover key patterns, clean the data, and visualize customer behaviors and campaign responses.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw telecom data
- Handle missing and invalid values
- Visualize key relationships and distributions
- Explore response trends based on job, education, age, and more
- Prepare encoded dataset for future modeling

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- DataPrep
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights

- Certain job roles and education levels showed higher campaign response rates
- Duration of last contact is a strong indicator of success
- Outliers in age and campaign activity were filtered to enhance data quality
